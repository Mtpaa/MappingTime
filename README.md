Working Titel [MappingTime][1]



The Page works local with the Crome-Browser, just under localhost.
With Mozilla Firefox the page the animation is slowly and "ticks" are missing in the
timeline.

- build a function that connects the informations of the sidebar, by clicking them, with the features
  in the map.  After clicking them a zoom and pananimation is activated.
- build a function to get ALL Informations of the geosjon visualized
- design sidebar and popupBox and toolTip
- make the variables  `duration` and  `steps` interactive for the user and make it
  possible for the user to play with the option  `getInterval`
- ~~into the sidebar(For Picturesvisualization over URL...change im Backend geojson-file new column "IMG_URL")~~
- a function to read ot the graphical informations of the features
  and visualizided the animated layer of the map
